## 🌎 About Me

Beyond coding, I’m deeply inspired by creativity and detail.

🎵 Music is a big part of my life — it fuels my focus and creativity.  
📸 I’m a beginner in photography, always learning to capture moments, light, and atmosphere.  
☕ I worked at :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, where I learned the value of consistency, customer experience, and attention to detail.  
🌅 I love sunsets — they remind me to slow down, reflect, and appreciate progress.

I believe technology and creativity go hand in hand, and I’m always looking for ways to combine both.
